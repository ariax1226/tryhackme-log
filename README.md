## TryHackMe Progress

### April 2025 
✅ What is Networking?
Learned about: IPs, routers, switches, MAC vs IP address, ports, and how devices talk to each other.
Tools/Concepts: Packet sniffing, basic protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, DNS).
Fav part: It was bite-sized but super visual — felt like watching how internet magic works under the hood.

✅ Offensive Security Intro
Learned about: Ethical hacking, scanning, enumeration, finding vulnerable pages, legal boundaries.
Tools/Concepts: Nmap, reconnaissance basics.
Fav part: Hacking a practice site and seeing it actually react — like damn, I really broke something (legally).

✅ Defensive Security Intro
Learned about: Threat intelligence, malware analysis, SOC (Security Operations Center), DFIR, and SIEM tools.
Tools/Concepts: Threat feeds, log analysis, security alerts.
Fav part: It’s all detective-mode — figuring out how to protect systems and analyze attacks.

✅ Careers in Cyber
Learned about: Job roles like Red Team (attack), Blue Team (defense), SOC Analyst, Pentester, Malware Analyst.
Tools/Concepts: Career roadmap, required skills, soft vs tech skills.
Fav part: Helped me see how many paths exist in cybersec, all of them are super cool.
